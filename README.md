## two-step approach to Lidar-Camera calibration
Abstract —— We propose a two-step approach (coarse + fine) for the external calibration between a camera and a multiple-line Lidar. First, a new closed-form solution is proposed to obtain the initial calibration parameters. With the initial calibration parameters, the ICP-based calibration framework is used to register the point clouds which extracted from the camera and Lidar coordinate frames, respectively. Our method has been applied to two Lidarcamera systems: an HDL-64E Lidar-camera system, and a VLP-16 Lidar-camera system.
